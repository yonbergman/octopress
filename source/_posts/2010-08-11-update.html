So the last several days I've been hard at work on several stuff most of them computer related,<p />The first was getting ready for the Interview at Google.<br />I went over lots of stuff from threading, writing java code on paper without eclipse (GASP), algorithms , and some programming riddles. It was really fun and some of it nostalgic.<br /> The interviews went really well and they were fun! you don't really expect that from an interview.<br />The people who interviewed me were nice and the whole interview itself where you solve problems reminded me of an interview I had long ago and is really fun.<br /> I have a callback for several more interviews next week which is good, so here's hoping.<p />The second thing is working on the new version of &pi;-zza, <br />I learned some JQuery so that the new site will be more responsive (hurray for ajax) and implements several views to use it to display information.<br /> The coolest thing was implementing endless scroll <a href="http://justinfrench.com/notebook/pagination-alternatives" target="_blank">(read this)</a> using a jquery plugin and some hacking to make it work =)<br />I changed the entire look and feel of the site, it's a bit more sleeker but still a bit empty (working on it). <br />
<p></p>
<br />Completely rewrote the algorithm and interface of the solver had some nice epiphanies while going over an algorithm book<br />and I added tests for the new algorithm/interface , testing in python is just so easy (creating and using mock objects is just so trivial its a crime not to do it) &lt;3 Python.<br /> I also decided to change the way calculation works by using the new features that App Engine has for background tasks - still haven't implemented yet :) but I have stuff ready for it.<br />I hope I have a stable version in the next couple of days, I even bought a domain for it <em>my first .com</em> (that sounds like a lame children's book)<p /> The third thing was getting Android to work on a windows mobile phone I got, which I'll dedicate a post to soon.<p />The last thing is some secret project which I probably will never reveal but you should know I'm having a blast creating it.<br /> --&nbsp; <br />- Yon
