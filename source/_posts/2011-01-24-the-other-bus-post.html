<p><span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">I haven't written in quite sometime and this is a special post, I wrote this entire post (except this line) while waiting for the bus today.<p />I've been mostly busy with<strong>&nbsp;work</strong>, I've learned a lot this past few months about RoR (which I really like), Web Development - which is really fun and About Start ups and how they work.<br /><a href="http://dailypig.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" style="color: #7799bb;">The Daily Pig</a>&nbsp;which I mentioned last post has reached 60 episodes which is impressive. I enjoy the ritual that has grown around the whole thing&nbsp; and especially on days when we have a good picture :).<br />Like the really awesome Angry Birds episode we had a couple of weeks back.<br /></span></p>
I've been working a bit on my&nbsp;<strong>art</strong>&nbsp;althrough not as much as I would have wanted.&nbsp;<br />My biggest problem to date is that I have a hard time getting in "the zone" and drawing stuff conscientiously.&nbsp;<br />When I doodle nice things come out. But when I focus&nbsp; - nada. Maybe its a left brain right brain thing like in the book im reading right now..<br /><br />I want to tell you about a cool new site we started at work while doing one of our katas which I continued working on quite a lot after.&nbsp;<br />It's a site that helps you find the perfect screening for that movie you want to see and we call it&nbsp;<strong>Makom Tov</strong>&nbsp;Ba-Emtza (Good Seats in the Middle).<br />There will be several ways to interact with the site but the basics is you decide on several parameters Time,Location,Movie and it searches several Cinemas to find the best seats currently available.<br />It does all the heavy lifting for you, searching the internet for the best seats in the best cinema so you dont have to work hard.&nbsp;<br />I have lots of ideas how to make this site grow. I even bought a domain and everything and we've already got lots of positive feedback.&nbsp;<br />I have to give proper credits to erez for the idea and working on the codebase and gartner for his part&nbsp; in the initial kata.&nbsp;<br />I think will be launching the site for "public" beta this week watch my blog and I'll&nbsp; announce when you can use it (Initially were supporting Cinema Cities and Yes Planets).<p /><br />I'll also ramble&nbsp; a little bit more about how we had an awesome pairing set up when we did the kata for Makom-Tov.<br />I had some inspiration from the Pivotal Labs&nbsp;<a href="http://pivotallabs.com/users/jsusser/blog/articles/1505-pairing-tete-a-tete" target="_blank" style="color: #7799bb;">blog</a>&nbsp;- We set up a MacBook Air&nbsp; facing to one side of the desk while it's external mouse and keyboard were facing to the other side along with the external screen.<br />The screens were mirrored so we each saw really good what the other was doing and able to control almost at any moment. It was awesome and I recommend trying it once.<p />I'll love to hear from you on what sounds intresting and you want to hear more about (Ruby, Art, DailyPig, Katas, MakomTov...) Know that I did a post while waiting for the bus I might start writing more (hopefully).<br />--&nbsp;<br />- Yon</span></p>
