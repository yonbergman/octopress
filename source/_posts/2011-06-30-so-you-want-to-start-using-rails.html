<p>Some people have recently asked me about starting with Rails, most of them don't know Ruby or Rails and some don't even come from the web world. At work they also asked me to create a list of reading material for our new guy. So I worked on that and though about all these other people who want to start with the web and with Rails and decided to put this list - reformated up for your pleasure.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Quick note</strong></span></p>
<p>The Rails enviroment is a fast changing ecosystem this post was written on <b>June 2011</b> and I can't vouch how relevant it'll be several months from now.<br />If your'e going to start with Rails right now I would recommend using&nbsp;<strong>Ruby 1.87</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>Rails 3<br /></strong>Ruby 1.92 is new and it's nice but a lot of gems<em>&nbsp;have some problems (especially working with rvm)</em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Rails Setup</strong></span></p>
<p>The first thing to do is read the Rails Guide on <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">Getting Started</a>. It explains all the basics and its not to hard to go over.<br />After that I suggest reading some more guides and mostly try and write your own small site. a blog engine, a todo List, a restaurant rater...just build something.</p>
<p>Now most Rails guides will show you how to use Rails pretty much as-is, meaning that they use only the built in stuff in Rails.&nbsp;<br />I found that there are a lot of alternatives to stuff built-in in Rails that are easier to use than the defaults.<br />Quick definition - <strong>gem</strong> - is a Ruby software library.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HAML</strong> not erb<strong>&nbsp;- </strong>for a better templating system that works for you instead of the other way round (<a href="http://haml-lang.com/" title="HAML" target="_blank">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>SCSS (SASS)</strong>&nbsp;not css - because css is a pain in the ass to do right and SASS solves it (<a href="http://sass-lang.com/">link</a>)&nbsp;<br />I prefer to use SCSS because it's complient to css<br /><strong>Compass </strong>- a gem for working with scss/sass which has an amazing collection of prebuilt mixins. (<a href="http://compass-style.org/">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>RSPEC</strong> not rails-test - Much better testing framework (<a href="http://rspec.info/">link</a>)<br /><strong>Factory Girl</strong> , not Fixtures - For built in test data (<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Jammit</strong> - to bundle your assets for production. (<a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of these you can probably find a guide or even a RailsCast and you should use them.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>IDEs</strong></span></p>
<p>There are currently several IDEs you can use to write Rails</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RubyMine</strong> - my choice for editor. really nice, has basic refactoring and supports everything you need in an IDE (<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>VIM</strong> - with dotvim, really makes your vim a small ruby editor with git support and a lot of things (only if you like vim) (<a href="https://github.com/astrails/dotvim">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Aptana RadRails</strong> - an eclipse extention for rails, last time I used it - it wasn't so good but still worth checking out (<a href="http://www.aptana.com/products/radrails">link</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Textmate </strong>- A good text editor for Mac, Haven't used it but most rails'ers use it (<a href="http://macromates.com/">link</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Javascripts</strong></span></p>
<p>Instead of using the built in system of autogenerated Javascripts created by Rails, I recommend using your own Javascripts that you'll right completly indepentant of the Server.<br />I recommend using <strong>jQuery</strong> (<a href="http://jquery.com/">link</a>)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as the basic helper framework and on top of that use <strong>JavascriptMVC </strong>(<a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/">link</a>) for helping you create a more organized and clear javascript system.<br />There is a lot to say about &nbsp;including javascript in your site and I'll probably write a post about it someday :)</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Books</strong></span></p>
<p>I really like books from the Pragmatic Programmers and as a rails starter book I definitely recommend -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356549/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yonline0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=1934356549">Agile Web Development with Rails<br /></a>I read the 3rd edition <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356166/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yonline0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1934356166">Agile Web Development with Rails, Third Edition</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356166&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> back when I started which talked about Rails 2.3 and this 4th edition is about Rails 3 and suppose to be even better :)</p>
<p>I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356476/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=yonline0d-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1934356476">Metaprogramming Ruby</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1934356476&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> once you played a bit with the language it lets you understand a lot about how stuff works and how to build your own cool stuff.</p>
<p>In any case just search for Rails or Ruby and I'm sure you'll find some more books.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Drails%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%23&amp;tag=yonline0d-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">More books</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=yonline0d-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" height="1" alt="" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /></p>

<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<div>The official rails guide -&nbsp;<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/</a>&nbsp;- pretty good and&nbsp;comprehensive&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ruby from other languages -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/" target="_blank">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/</a>&nbsp;- explains the&nbsp;difference&nbsp;of ruby&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Starting rails -&nbsp;<a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/starting-ruby-on-rails-what-i-wish-i-knew/" target="_blank">http://betterexplained.com/articles/starting-ruby-on-rails-what-i-wish-i-knew/</a></span></div>
<div>RailsCasts - awesome video tutorials on tons of subjects (I don't have list of good episodes)&nbsp;<a href="http://railscasts.com/" target="_blank">http://railscasts.com/</a></div>
<div>and Rails for Zombies -&nbsp;<a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">http://railsforzombies.org/</a>&nbsp;- Haven't gone over it but heard it was good.</div>
<p />
<p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
<div>One last note about ruby, It was written in Japaenese so a lot of basic functions are there in the String class or the Collections class but have a different name from what you're probably used to.</div>
<div>For example to make a string lower case instead of str.lower_case or something like that its down_case.</div>
<div>I just google "ruby array" or "ruby string" when I need to find something that I need</div>
<div>:)</div>
<div>Enjoy Railsing :)</div>
