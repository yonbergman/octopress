I'm finally done with the first version of this iteration of n-zza.<br /><a href="http://www.n-zza.com" target="_blank">&nbsp;<a href="http://n-zza.com">http://n-zza.com</a><br /></a><br />It took me about three weeks of work and lots of refactoring and learning new stuff.<br /> The whole project is a lot more organized and easier to maintain it even has tests! &nbsp;<br />I'm proud of this version a lot more than I was with my first version in 08 I really believe that this version is usable and good. <br /> Just some statistics:<br />The old version had only 6 python files, no js files and 7 html templates.<br />The new version has more 14 python files (+2 test files) , 5 internal js files and 7 js libraries, and 11 html templates.<br /> Its still not that big code-base wise , but it has more features and is a big improvment.<p />So if you're having a party or an all-nighter and you want to order a pizza but don't want the hassle of collecting everyones order give nzza a chance. <br /> Just go to the site login with your Google account - create an event with the settings for your pizzeria (how many slices per pizza, which toppings can you order) <br />then send your friends a link to the event page where they can set their orders (how many slices they want and which toppings they eat). <br /> If one of your friends isn't next to a computer you can even set up an order for someone else. <br />After all the orders are set the site will give you the best solution it found in two forms. <br />The first is a list of pizzas to order in a format easy for the person placing the order to the pizzeria. <br /> The second is the list of people with how many slices of each topping they get. <br />

<br />Even if you're not planning a pizza event I would appreciate if you could pop into the site, try the features and post some <strong>feedback</strong>. <br /> You can find the site at <a href="http://www.n-zza.com" target="_blank">http://n-zza.com<br /></a>If for some reason you want to compare it to the old site (blech) you can still get a glimpse of the old version<a href="http://1.latest.nzza.appspot.com/" target="_blank"> over here</a><p /> Some ideas for the next versions: mobile version, facebook connectivity, increase restrictions , shuffle slices, better solution suggestion when failing, private events, invitations, connection to pizzeria API's I know dominoes have some sort of api in the US and other stuff. I would love hearing from you what other ideas you think I should add to the site.<p /> Next time I'll talk about bugs and dirty work and hopefully I will be able to tell tales of the site's first days.
