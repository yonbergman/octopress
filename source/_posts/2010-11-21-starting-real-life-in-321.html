<div>So...I haven't posted in a while, I didn't get sucked in to minecraft like some would think from my last post,&nbsp;but I got a job !</div>
<img src="/images/GiftsProjectSmall.jpg.scaled500.jpeg">
<div>I'm working at&nbsp;<strong>The Gifts Project</strong>&nbsp;which is a cool small start up.</div>
<div>We're located at&nbsp;Rothschild&nbsp;Av. which means there is an awesome vibe to the whole thing.</div>
<div>I've started cracking hard at Ruby (on Rails) and i'm really enjoying it so far, learned to play with Facebook API which is nice and lots of other stuff.&nbsp;</div>
<div>One thing I really like about the RoR framework is the way they handle developing with a DB and models, instead of setting up the DB upfront.</div>
<div>Which would have meant that you have to&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the changes you made or if you're organized you'll need to manage the DDT files by yourself and hope everyone&nbsp;remembers&nbsp;to do the same.</div>
<div>In RoR you have things called migrations which are instances of changes to the DB where you can create tables, create columns, change them &nbsp;and delete them. The cool thing is that each migration has a set up and &nbsp;tear down so you can easly rollback and pick and choose which migrations should run. Each new developer that starts working and needs to set up a local DB just needs to run a smaill task which runs all the migrations one after the other and builds the DB from the changes (Kind off like GIT vs SVN now that I think of it - which is also something new to get in to :) )</div>
<p />
<div>I've started weekly dojo meetings for the entire programing team where we sit for 40 mins and try and solve a problem on the LCD that we have =)</div>
<div>We started with the most basic kata of all the String Calculator and everyone loved it.</div>
<img src="/images/DailyPig.png.scaled500.png">
<div>The other cool thing I started was&nbsp;<strong>The Daily Pig&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://dailypig.tumblr.com/">(link)</a>.</div>
<div>Someone ordered a set of pig&nbsp;erasers&nbsp;which looked really cute and put them on a shelf in the middle of the office, once in a while</div>
<div>someone would walk up to them and play with them - putting them on top of each other, making the pigs fuck each other, setting them in army formations and other stuff.</div>
<div>So we talked and came up with the idea of uploading them to a blog, so I set up a tumblr account for them and since that every day we've set up a new scene.</div>
<div>We'll love to get ideas from you.</div>
<p />
<div>I'll leave you with a song that we hear about 3-4 times a day, It's a chap-hop song (a new type of Victorian Hip-Hop).</div>
