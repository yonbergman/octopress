The holidays are a great excuse for why I haven&#39;t updated the blog so you won&#39;t know the real reason why (laziness and addiction to Minecraft)
<p />I&#39;ll start with telling you that<b> launching n-zza</b> it just couldn&#39;t get any traction I need to find a medium to distribute it.<br />
I had a small bug in the JS which worked perfectly in Firefox but not in Webkit browsers (Chrome,Safari), the bug was in the create button so people using those browsers just couldn&#39;t open a new event.<br />I fixed it fairly early but I missed the first several people who of course used Chrome, so that sucks.<br /> I also tried to use Forrst (mentioned it the last blag) to get some people review the site both from a design point and from a product view but according to my analytics numbers only 3 people actually went in there and I got no comments.<br /> How do I make something viral ? (I bet that&#39;s never been asked before) <br />I think I&#39;ll try to implement the facebook connect as fast as possible and hopefully that will bring in some users.<p /><p /> <b>Phone update: </b>I finally went to my cell carrier to get the SIM and it was just easy.<br />They have this awesome system where you can schedule an appointment using their site and you just get there and it&#39;s your turn.<br /> The sucky thing was to make it work with the carrier I needed to search the internet to find on which freq the phone should work, that was a bit scary thinking that maybe the phone doesn&#39;t fit the network. <br />Then I had to move my contacts from the old phone to the new one which was a saga all on its own.<br /> I rummaged around the room and found the old data cable and found a program from 2003 that manages the phone, but there was something broken with my phone and it only accepted to move 12 contacts from my phone to the computer.<br /> So I opened a spreadsheet and manually wrote down almost my entire phonebook (I took the time to do a little bit housecleaning since the phone is with me since &#39;04).<br />After doing that I tried to find a way to move all of my numbers to my phone, there was a little nice program that happened to do that but it needed a CSV with a different format then what I had - so naturally Python!<br /> Then I tried to check how well the new android work on an actuall phone, so it works pretty well and I can even make and receive calls except that the sound doesn&#39;t work at all.<br />So that sucks I&#39;m going to try and check that out so I can start using android instead of this horrible Windows Mobile.<p /> <br />I also attended the 3rd meeting of the <b>Israeli Software Craftsmanship Group</b>.<br />It was nice but I had the feeling that we allready discused those same topics in previous meetings and like the book clean code.<br /> Some of the people that come to these meeting just come to nitpick and take the life out of the event - boo for them.<br />We had another dojo this time we did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_number">Lychrel numbers</a> (which I still am not sure how you should pronounce) it was almost more organized than the last one.<br /> But in the end it was just as messy, even though this time we finished it ! and then someone un-finshed it...=(<br />I enjoyed learning a bit about TDD though I&#39;m having a hard time expanding the concept from solving little riddles to using it on a large scale project. (Hint hint abyx ;) )<p /> Still on track in Google in case you&#39;re wondering, hope for more news soon.<p />Just one word about <b>Minecraft </b>before I leave for tonight.<br />It&#39;s is an indie game which was developed by one dude (<i>respect</i>) it&#39;s written totally in Java (<i>double respect</i>) and it&#39;s amazing.<br /> The game has no real purpose you get what you want form it and it plays however you play it.<br />It totally random generated and you can destroy everything and build anything you want (as long as you can craft it)<br />It has monsters and lava and pigs and mining and rollercoasters and its only in alpha.<br /> It&#39;s seen some major publicity lately from penny arcade and RPS, I recommend you read this <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/mine-the-gap/">journal from RPS</a> to maybe get and idea of what the games like, plus it&#39;s fun to read stories about peoples adventures.<br /> Here is a screenshot from my current game - It&#39;s a glass observatory I build with a waterfall coming out of it I accidentally poured down lava at first that&#39;s why a tree is still burning.<br /><br /> It costs only 10 Euros and you also get all future versions plus a big update each week, yesterday he added fishing rods and the ability to sneak.
<br />Plus for the next several days due to issues on the server it&#39;s 
<a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">completely free</a>, but beware you might get hooked..<p /> Till next time, I&#39;ve been Yon
