So I&#39;m getting along nicely with the site, <br />I&#39;ve created a small feature list so I have a place to put new ideas into.<br />Lately I&#39;m having a lot of these and that&#39;s even before anyone really used the site...<p /> Facebook and the social graph:<br />I&#39;m currently reading &#39;The Facebook Effect&quot; which is a book about the founding of Facebook and the growth of the company. <br />It&#39;s a good book and it&#39;s really interesting to read about how they got to where they are.<br /> I think it made me better understand a lot more about the mechanics of the site and the ideas behind stuff.<br />It also made me think how I can make n-zza better if I add the Facebook connectivity (everything from helping people use the service and getting more people into the service)<br /> I read about it on-line and there are a lot of post on using GAE and Facebook connect mostly though its using the Python API and some JavaScript API to make some very straightforward stuff.<br />So this is definitely one of the features I&#39;ll pursue to add to n-zza probably after launch.<br /> <img title="the-facebook-effect.jpg" src="http://facebookflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/the-facebook-effect.jpg" height="200" alt="the-facebook-effect.jpg" width="131" /><p /><br />A big thing I solved this week is how to display a long checklist of items to the user.<br /> I started by browsing google for inspiration - None there. So I turned to a new community that i&#39;ve recently joined <a href="http://www.forrst.com/" target="_blank">Forrst</a>. Forrst is a site for developers and designers to come and share micro pieces of work (code,screen-shots and links) and get feedback and response about them - it&#39;s kind off like a professional Tumblr.<br /> Anyhow I looked around and found some stuff that people did and I though of a way to fix my problem. I&#39;m pretty pleased with it, except one little thing that I&#39;ll mention in the next paragraph.<br /><p /> So after adding the new display to n-zza , and after I added the background tasks and ajax auto refresh (which is totally cool by the way) I though I was almost done with the first version of the site (second if you count the version from &#39;08).<br /> I asked my girlfriend if she could use the site while I watch her without guiding her, I just told her what the site is about in a quick sentence.<br />She started to use the site and I just wanted to die - the site is just so unusable. It&#39;s just not clear what the stuff I put up mean.<br /> I&#39;m usually very conscious about user experience but this time I totally blew it, I decided that before I&#39;ll open up the site I have to upgrade the site UX-wise.<br />I have a plan of how to make the site more clear and streamline without adding to much text , I was also thinking of creating an explanatory video with infographics and such but that will have to wait.<p />  Small Google update, I just passed another step of the process today - and things look good.<p />Till next time -Yon
