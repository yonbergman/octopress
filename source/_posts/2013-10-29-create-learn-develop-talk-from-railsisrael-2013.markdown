Earlier this month I had the opportunity to give a talk at the Rails Israel conference. I had a great time with all the wonderful people who came there. Big shoutout to all the speakers who came in from all over the world and to [@fogelmania](http://twitter.com/fogelmania) for organising it all.

Here are the slides and a video from the talk.
I'll be posting a more indepth post about [passion projects](/2013/10/29/passion-projects-code-you-love/), the subject of the talk along side this post.

Thanks for listening to me babble, hope you liked the talk.
