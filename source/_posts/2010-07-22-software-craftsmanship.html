Last Night I attended the second Israeli software craftsmanship meeting, and it was really fun.<br />It&#39;s great to find a group of people who really care about their profession and not just go with the flow.<br /> At the end of the meeting we did about 40 min of coding dojo we did the Roman Numerals one, it was my first dojo but I really enjoyed it. <br />Our group (the Java group) wasn&#39;t that well organized but I totally saw the potential in doing coding dojos with a group of people you like.<p /> Today abyx showed me a platform for running dojos in a more streamlined kind of way <a href="http://www.cyber-dojo.com/">http://www.cyber-dojo.com/</a><br />I think that in conjunction with Skype you can even hold remote coding dojo using it (not that sure about it but it looks like).<br /> But it definitely is something I&#39;ll try to arrange some day.<p />So If you care about software and would like to meet other people that care come join the LinkedIn group <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=2578449">http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=2578449</a>.
