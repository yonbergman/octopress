So the bulk of this post is going to talk about how I got android on my HTC phone, <br />just wanted to tell you what the secret project from last week was - It was a video I made for my girlfriend for her birthday, it was an old spice ripoff and I'm proud and embarrassed on how it came out, so there.<br /> Also had the second set of interviews at Google, they went well, now we wait =)<p />A couple of months ago I got an old <strong>HTC Tytn ii </strong>- which is a real step up from the shitty Samsung phone I currently use (which thanks to my cellular provider I had to go to miles end just to get damn MP3 ringtones - a feature of the device mind you)<br /> The problem with the phone that it runs a windows mobile 6 OS which has virtually no applications.<br />Do I really need applications for my phone? probably not, but I'm a geek so when I heard from a friend that the INTERNETZ is porting Android for Windows Mobile phones I decided to take a look.<p /> I read around on the forums where they're doing that and I found all these half-written zero-maintained wikis floating around in space. <br />I understood that there are two methods one is to run Android from your SD card and the other is to change the bootrom - naturally I opted for the SD method first, to make sure that it works before I accidentally get stuck with a cool black glossy brick with a keyboard.<br /> So I got to work and downloaded several different versions of Android for WM tried them one by one and just nothing.<br />See the process of going from Windows to Android includes using a program called <em>Haret </em>to boot Linux (it makes the cool effect of Linux cli loading on a phone which always makes my smirk.)<br /> and then it boots a image of android, but before you can load the android you have to go through some sort of installation menu which creates the data and system files and get the system ready for the first time,<br />Sounds simple enough a installation menu - I could handle that...<br /> <img title="touch_diamond_android.jpg" src="http://www.gsmdome.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/touch_diamond_android.jpg" alt="touch_diamond_android.jpg" /><p /> But I got stuck for the longest time with some stupid problem - for the installation menu to appear you have to hold a certain button for several seconds at a specific time.<br />I just couldn't make it work, didn't matter which button I tried, didn't matter when or how much it just didn't go to the menu.<br /> After several days getting angry at the phone and getting no help from the forums (except several other people who had the same problem) I decided to apply some voodoo.<br />I reformatted the SD card to FAT32, re-downloaded the roms did some hockus pockus and in a way I can't explain some mystery rom suddenly worked, but at half the resolution of the screen and with no wifi or camera meaning FAIL.<br /> Sad and defeated I forgot about it for several weeks.<p />Until this week when I decided that I'm going to make it work!<br />I went back to the forums read about the progress and found a new rom which had a fix to include wifi and bluetooth and the even the camera works,<br /> I downloaded it, set it up and on the first try I got android running in a perfect resolution with wifi and stuff working. That's cool.<br />Once I got the android market working I download several apps like facebook, twitter and some cool Israeli bus application.<br /> So now I have a dual-boot phone Win/And [that eats through the whole battery in a couple of hours (Ordered a new one)]<p />It only had to problems and old Battery and no sim card, I ordered a new batttery from dealextreme which arrived today in the mail (Hurray) so now the only thing I'm missing is the Sim card.<br /> My currently shitty phone is a CDMA which means no SIM so I have to go crawling to my cellular provider to give me a SIM card and enable my account on the GSM network. <br /> I had a talk with one of the "informed and smart" representatives and I was told that there is absolutely no option to do that- and that the only option is to buy a new line; a new package and a new phone.<br />I gave him a WTF you talking about willis stare and he stood ground for the first several seconds but then his confidence started to waiver and he went back to ask one of the other people there and came back with a maybe that's possible maybe it costs thisandthat to buy a Sim and generally a feeling that I can totally trust him.<br /> I decided to try my luck with a larger office where hopefully people will know how to help me.<br />Wish me good luck with that.
