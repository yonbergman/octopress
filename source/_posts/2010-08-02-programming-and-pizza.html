I recently finished reading <strong>Microserfs </strong>(in only 3 days)<br />It's a great book that tells the story of a small group of friends who leave Microsoft to create a cool product in the 90's.<br />It's a must read for any techie that respects himself =)<br /> It really got my programming juices flowing so I decided to go back to an old project of mine.<p />About two years ago when google came out with the app-engine I decided to try my best and create a small application/site<br /> for ordering pizzas for team nights when a bunch of people meet together and then you have the nightmare of toppings =)<br />It's an idea that was in the back of my head for several years , ever since a night of coding that had just a horrible pizza ordering ordeal.<br /> <br />So I took a couple of days (well actually afternoons and nights) and created the site,<br />Looking back after these two years I'm a little ashamed , even thought I had to teach myself most of the technologies - doesn't make me less squirm when I look at it all.<br /> The code is a mess, at the time I mostly worked in Java meaning the back and forth between languages and all makes the python look weird.<br />The css/html are bad done using I hope this works method using the great Firebug.<br /> I remembered I was really happy with the design but again looking back - blah!.<br />The fact that site has no Ajax at all because I just learned JavaScript so I mostly dabbled with stuff on my one (no library), which is usually ok because a site doesn't have to have ajax for the sake of ajax is really <br /> It's stable (at least ^_^) but alas nobody has ever used it (expect me).<p />I still like the name <strong>n-zza </strong>pronounced <strong>pi-zza (</strong>really geeky of me I know) and I like the logo and the concept.<br />So I decided I'll put in a couple of days which I have more than enough of today to recreate the site almost from scratch make it faster better and more useable, heck I don't really care if in the end I still have something that no-one uses but I want something that I'll be proud of.<p /> I'll keep you (the 0 people reading this) posted on how it's going and when it's done I'll post the link
